# Simkey VS Code

Visual Studio Code extension for the simkey language.

This extension provides a basic highlighter that is mostly accurate for the Simkey language.

Simkey is a simple language to write repetitive macros. While there are certainly more powerful options, Simkey strives to make repetitive tasks that don't require active inputs or screen readers exceptionally easy and efficient to automate. 

You can press, hold, and release keys, as well as move the cursor and scroll, while controlling the timing and parallelization, in a very concise syntax.
